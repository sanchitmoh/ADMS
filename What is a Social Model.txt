What is a Social Model?

A Social Model describes:

People (actors) involved in the system

Roles and responsibilities of each actor

Interactions and communication between actors


In many hospitals and clinics, patients still face difficulties such as long waiting times, manual registration, uncertain appointment availability, and lack of proper communication with doctors.
From a user’s point of view, the main goal is to book, view, and manage appointments easily without visiting the clinic physically.

🔹 User Goals

Book appointments online at convenient time slots

View doctor availability in advance

Receive appointment confirmation and reminders

Avoid long queues and paperwork

🔹 Obstacles Faced by Users

Manual appointment booking process

No real-time availability information

Appointment clashes and delays

No centralized record of appointments
